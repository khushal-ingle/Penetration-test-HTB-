## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

There are multiple methods to calculate the severity of vulnerabilities. The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** is the most widely used industry standard for this purpose.

Most vulnerability scanning tools automatically assign CVSS scores to findings. However, security professionals must understand how these scores are calculated so they can:

* Manually calculate scores if needed
* Validate scanner results
* Justify severity ratings to stakeholders

CVSS is often used alongside **Microsoft DREAD**, a risk assessment framework developed by Microsoft.

## Microsoft DREAD Model

DREAD is a qualitative risk analysis model that scores threats on a scale of 0 to 10 using five factors:

1. **Damage Potential** – How severe the damage would be if exploited
2. **Reproducibility** – How easily the attack can be repeated
3. **Exploitability** – How easy it is to exploit
4. **Affected Users** – How many users would be impacted
5. **Discoverability** – How easily the vulnerability can be found

This model helps security teams prioritize vulnerabilities and is an important part of Microsoft’s security strategy.

## CVSS Severity Scoring Overview

CVSS categorizes vulnerabilities based on two main components:

* **Exploitability**
* **Impact**

These components are grouped into three metric categories:

1. Base Metric Group
2. Temporal Metric Group
3. Environmental Metric Group

---

## CVSS Metric Groups

### Base Metric Group

The Base Metric Group represents the inherent characteristics of a vulnerability that do not change over time or across environments.

It consists of:

* Exploitability Metrics
* Impact Metrics

#### Exploitability Metrics

These measure how difficult it is to exploit a vulnerability:

* **Attack Vector** – How the vulnerability is accessed (network, local, physical, etc.)
* **Attack Complexity** – Conditions beyond the attacker’s control
* **Privileges Required** – Level of access needed
* **User Interaction** – Whether user action is required

#### Impact Metrics

Impact metrics measure the consequences of a successful exploit and are based on the **CIA Triad**.

---

## CIA Triad

The CIA Triad represents the three core principles of information security:

* **Confidentiality** – Ensuring only authorized users can access data
* **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered
* **Availability** – Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed

##### Confidentiality Impact

* High impact: Theft of passwords, encryption keys, or sensitive data
* Low impact: Access to non-critical information

##### Integrity Impact

* High impact: Modification of critical business data
* Low impact: Limited or uncontrolled data modification

##### Availability Impact

* High impact: Complete system or service outage
* Low impact: Partial service disruption

---

## Temporal Metric Group

The Temporal Metric Group reflects factors that change over time, such as exploit availability or patch status.

### Exploit Code Maturity

This metric measures how likely exploitation is based on available exploit code.

Values include:

* **Not Defined** – Metric not used
* **High** – Reliable, automated exploits exist
* **Functional** – Working public exploit code available
* **Proof-of-Concept** – PoC exists but requires modification
* **Unproven** – No known exploit

---

### Remediation Level

This metric reflects the availability of fixes.

Values include:

* **Not Defined** – Metric not used
* **Unavailable** – No fix exists
* **Workaround** – Unofficial mitigation available
* **Temporary Fix** – Vendor-provided temporary solution
* **Official Fix** – Vendor has released a patch

---

### Report Confidence

This metric measures how well the vulnerability is documented.

Values include:

* **Not Defined** – Metric not used
* **Confirmed** – Multiple reliable sources confirm the vulnerability
* **Reasonable** – Some evidence exists, but details may be incomplete
* **Unknown** – Limited or unclear information

---

## Environmental Metric Group

The Environmental Metric Group adjusts the CVSS score based on the **specific organization’s environment**.

### Modified Base Metrics

These metrics allow organizations to redefine the importance of the CIA triad for their environment.

Values include:

* **Not Defined** – Metric not used
* **High** – Severe impact on organization and customers
* **Medium** – Significant impact
* **Low** – Minimal impact

This ensures the CVSS score reflects real-world business risk, not just technical severity.

---

## Calculating CVSS Severity

CVSS version 3.1 calculations combine all Base, Temporal, and Environmental metrics into a final score between 0.0 and 10.0.

The official calculator is provided by the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**.

---

## CVSS Calculation Example

For example:

* **Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**
* CVSS Base Score: **8.8**

This high score reflects:

* Network-based exploitation
* High impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability

---

## Key Takeaways

* CVSS is the industry standard for vulnerability severity scoring
* Base metrics measure inherent technical risk
* Temporal metrics reflect exploit and patch availability
* Environmental metrics align severity with business impact
* CVSS scores help prioritize remediation effectively
