## Vulnerability Scanning Overview

**Vulnerability scanning** is an automated process used to identify known or potential security weaknesses in an organization’s environment. It targets a wide range of assets, including:

* Network devices (routers, firewalls, switches)
* Servers
* Workstations
* Applications (especially web applications)

Vulnerability scanners focus on **detection**, not exploitation. While scanners may occasionally perform safe validation checks, **human review is always required** to determine whether findings are:

* Real vulnerabilities that require remediation, or
* False positives that can be excluded from future scans

## Vulnerability Scanning vs Penetration Testing

Although vulnerability scanning is often part of a **penetration test**, the two are not the same.

* **Vulnerability scanning**

  * Automated
  * Identifies known or potential issues
  * Does not prove exploitability

* **Penetration testing**

  * Manual and automated
  * Actively exploits vulnerabilities
  * Demonstrates real-world impact

During a penetration test, vulnerability scans are often used to:

* Increase coverage
* Save time under tight project deadlines
* Identify low-hanging issues early

However, a penetration test always includes much more than scanning alone.

---

## Types of Vulnerability Scanning Tests

Most vulnerability scanners use a combination of **static** and **dynamic** testing techniques.

### Static Testing

Static tests identify vulnerabilities based on:

* Software version detection
* Known vulnerabilities mapped to public CVEs

Limitations:

* A detected version may already be patched
* The vulnerability may not be exploitable in the current configuration

Static detection alone can produce false positives.

---

### Dynamic Testing

Dynamic tests actively interact with the target using safe payloads, such as:

* Weak credential checks
* SQL injection attempts
* Command injection attempts

If a payload succeeds, there is a higher likelihood that the vulnerability is real.

Dynamic testing is commonly used for web applications and services.

## Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scanning

Organizations should run both scan types on a regular basis.

### Unauthenticated Scans

* Simulate an external attacker
* Identify publicly exposed vulnerabilities
* Useful for perimeter security testing

### Authenticated Scans

* Use valid credentials
* Provide deeper visibility
* Identify missing patches, insecure configurations, and privilege-related issues

Running both scan types continuously helps ensure:

* New vulnerabilities are detected quickly
* Newly added assets are properly secured
* Patch levels remain consistent

Vulnerability scanning results should directly feed into an organization’s **patch management program**.

## Common Vulnerability Scanning Tools

Several commercial and open-source platforms are widely used:

* **Nessus**
* **Qualys**
* **Nexpose**
* **OpenVAS**

Some tools offer free or trial editions to help users evaluate their capabilities.

## Nessus Overview

**Nessus Essentials** by **Tenable** is the free version of the Nessus vulnerability scanner.

Key characteristics:

* Free for personal or learning use
* Limited to **16 hosts**
* Reduced feature set compared to paid versions
* Suitable for beginners and lab environments

Nessus Essentials performs automated scans to identify vulnerabilities across operating systems, services, and applications.

Example scan results may include:

* Hundreds of detected vulnerabilities
* CVSS scoring (v3.x)
* Identification of critical issues such as Log4j or outdated Java components
* Detailed remediation guidance

## OpenVAS Overview

**OpenVAS**, developed by **Greenbone Networks**, is a fully open-source vulnerability scanning platform.

Key features:

* Network-based vulnerability scanning
* Authenticated and unauthenticated testing
* Large vulnerability database (NVTs – Network Vulnerability Tests)
* Web-based management interface (Greenbone Security Assistant)

OpenVAS provides:

* Severity-based vulnerability classification
* CVE tracking
* Trend analysis and reporting

It is commonly used by organizations and learners who prefer open-source security tools.

## Key Takeaways

* Vulnerability scanning is automated and detection-focused
* Human validation is required to confirm findings
* Scanning is not the same as penetration testing
* Static and dynamic tests complement each other
* Authenticated scans provide deeper visibility
* Nessus and OpenVAS are widely used scanning tools
