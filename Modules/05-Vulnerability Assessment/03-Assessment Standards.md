## Assessment Standards

Both **Vulnerability Assessments** and **Penetration Tests** must follow recognized standards to be accepted by governments, regulators, and legal authorities. These standards ensure assessments are performed consistently, thoroughly, and ethically. Following standards also improves assessment quality and reduces the likelihood of security incidents.

---

## Compliance Standards

Regulatory and compliance bodies define information security standards that organizations must follow to maintain certification. These certifications are important because:

- They confirm that security has been reviewed by a third party
    
- Some businesses will not work with organizations that lack required certifications
    
- They help meet legal and regulatory obligations
    

Major compliance standards include:

- **PCI DSS**
    
- **HIPAA**
    
- **FISMA**
    
- **ISO 27001**

## PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

**PCI DSS** applies to organizations that store, process, or transmit credit card data. Although it is not a government regulation, it is mandatory for any organization handling payment card information.

Examples include:

- Banks
    
- E-commerce companies
    
- Businesses with their own payment systems
    

Key PCI DSS requirements:

- Regular internal and external vulnerability scans
    
- Secure handling of cardholder data
    
- Separation of sensitive systems into a **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)**
    
- Strong access controls and monitoring
    

The **CDE** must be isolated from the rest of the network to reduce the risk of data compromise and unauthorized access.

**PCI DSS Goals**:

- Build and maintain secure networks
    
- Protect cardholder data
    
- Maintain a vulnerability management program
    
- Implement strong access controls
    
- Monitor and test networks regularly
    
- Maintain an information security policy

## HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

**HIPAA** is a U.S. law designed to protect patient health information.

Important points:

- Vulnerability scans are not explicitly required
    
- Organizations must perform **risk assessments**
    
- Vulnerabilities must be identified and managed
    
- Security controls must protect patient data confidentiality and integrity
    

HIPAA focuses more on **risk management** than on specific testing tools.

---

## FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)

**FISMA** applies to U.S. government agencies and contractors.

Requirements include:

- Documented vulnerability management program
    
- Evidence of risk assessments
    
- Protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)
    
- Ongoing monitoring and reporting
    

Organizations must prove they are actively managing vulnerabilities to remain compliant.

---

## ISO 27001

**ISO 27001** is an internationally recognized information security standard.

Key requirements:

- Implementation of an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**
    
- Regular risk assessments
    
- Quarterly internal and external vulnerability scans
    
- Continuous improvement of security controls
    

ISO 27001 compliance focuses on managing risk, not just meeting checklist requirements.

Important note:  
Compliance alone should not drive vulnerability management. Security programs must consider:

- Organizational risk appetite
    
- Business objectives
    
- Environment-specific threats
    

---

## Penetration Testing Standards

Penetration testing must follow strict rules and guidelines.

Before any test:

- Scope must be clearly defined
    
- Written legal authorization is required
    
- Activities must be documented
    

During testing:

- Avoid unnecessary system changes
    
- Avoid deleting or modifying data
    
- Limit data extraction
    
- Use screenshots or metadata as proof instead of copying sensitive files

## Common Penetration Testing Standards

### PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

**PTES** defines a complete penetration testing lifecycle and can be applied to any type of pentest.

PTES Phases:

1. Pre-engagement interactions
    
2. Intelligence gathering
    
3. Threat modeling
    
4. Vulnerability analysis
    
5. Exploitation
    
6. Post-exploitation
    
7. Reporting
    

---

### OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)

**OSSTMM** provides a structured methodology for security testing and can be used alongside other standards.

OSSTMM Testing Channels:

- Human security (social engineering)
    
- Physical security
    
- Wireless communications
    
- Telecommunications
    
- Data networks
    

---

### NIST Penetration Testing Framework

**NIST** provides guidelines widely used by governments and enterprises.

NIST Penetration Testing Phases:

1. Planning
    
2. Discovery
    
3. Attack
    
4. Reporting
    

NIST also supports broader security frameworks such as risk management and incident response.

---

### OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)

**OWASP** focuses on application security, especially web and mobile applications.

OWASP provides:

- Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)
    
- Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)
    
- Firmware Security Testing Methodology
    
- Vulnerability classification standards
    

OWASP is the industry standard for web application security testing.
