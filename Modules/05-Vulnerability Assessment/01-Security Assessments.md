## Security Assessments 

Every organization needs to **check how secure their systems are** from time to time. These checks are called **security assessments**.

The main goal is simple:

- Find **weaknesses (vulnerabilities)**
    
- Fix them **before attackers exploit them**
    

Different companies need different types of checks depending on:

- Their size
    
- Industry (bank, hospital, startup, etc.)
    
- Laws and compliance rules
    
- How mature their security is
    

Some companies are beginners, others are very advanced — but **everyone must do security assessments**.

## Vulnerability Assessment (VA)

Think of a **vulnerability assessment** as a **security checklist**.

### What it does:

- Checks systems against known security standards
    
- Finds **known vulnerabilities**
    
- Confirms whether systems are configured securely
    

### Key points:

- Uses **standards** like GDPR, PCI-DSS, OWASP, etc.
    
- Often uses **automated scanners**
    
- Focuses on **finding and validating vulnerabilities**
    
- Does **NOT** try to fully hack the system
    

### Example questions:

- Is this server patched?
    
- Is weak encryption being used?
    
- Is this service misconfigured?
    

### Best for:

- All organizations
    
- Beginners in security
    
- Monthly or quarterly security checks

## Penetration Testing (Pentesting)

A **penetration test** is a **legal hacking exercise**.

### What it does:

- Simulates a **real cyber attack**
    
- Tests if an attacker can **break into systems**
    
- Shows **how far an attacker can go**
    

### Key difference from a real attack:

- Fully **authorized**
    
- Strict **legal agreement**
    
- Clear rules (scope)
    

### Outcome:

- Detailed report
    
- Real-world attack paths
    
- High-impact security findings

## Types of Penetration Tests

### 1. Black Box Testing

- Tester knows **nothing**
    
- Acts like an external attacker
    
- Must discover everything
    

Example:  
“Here’s our company name. Try to hack us.”

---

### 2. Grey Box Testing

- Tester has **limited knowledge**
    
- Like a normal employee (not IT)
    
- Given some IPs or access
    

Example:  
“Here’s internal access like a receptionist would have.”

---

### 3. White Box Testing

- Tester has **full access**
    
- Source code, configs, documentation
    
- Goal: find **maximum vulnerabilities**
    

Example:  
“Here’s everything. Find all possible security flaws.”

---

## Types of Pentesters

### Application Pentesters

- Test web apps, APIs, mobile apps
    
- Do source code reviews
    
- Focus on OWASP-style issues
    

---

### Network / Infrastructure Pentesters

- Test:
    
    - Servers
        
    - Firewalls
        
    - Active Directory
        
    - Windows & Linux systems
        
- Use scanners like Nessus **plus manual techniques**
    
- Scanners help, but **humans are essential**
    

---

### Physical Pentesters

- Test physical security
    

Examples:

- Can they tailgate into an office?
    
- Can they enter restricted areas?
    
- Can they access servers physically?
    

---

### Social Engineering Pentesters

- Test **people**, not systems
    

Examples:

- Phishing emails
    
- Fake phone calls
    
- Pretending to be an employee
    

---

## Security Maturity (Very Important Concept)

**Security maturity** = how advanced a company’s security is.

### High maturity organizations have:

- Skilled security teams
    
- Strong policies
    
- Regular patching
    
- Incident response plans
    
- Security awareness training
    
- CISO / CTO
    
- Security-first culture
    

### Low maturity organizations:

- Should start with **vulnerability assessments**
    
- Pentests may find _too many issues_ to handle
    

---

## Vulnerability Assessment vs Penetration Test

### Vulnerability Assessment:

- Finds known issues
    
- Checklist-based
    
- Cheaper
    
- Less skill required
    
- No real attack simulation
    

### Penetration Test:

- Simulates real attacks
    
- Shows real impact
    
- Expensive
    
- Requires experts
    
- Finds complex attack chains
    

 **Both are useful — one is not better than the other**

---

## Security Audits

Security audits are **mandatory** checks.

### Examples:

- **PCI-DSS** for credit card payments
    
- Government or industry regulations
    

### Important:

- Audits are enforced by **external bodies**
    
- Failure can lead to:
    
    - Fines
        
    - Legal issues
        
    - Loss of business
        

---

## Bug Bounty Programs

Companies invite **ethical hackers** from the public to find bugs.

### Key points:

- Hackers get paid for valid bugs
    
- No automated scanning (usually)
    
- Requires strong internal security teams
    

### Best for:

- Large companies
    
- High security maturity
    

Examples:

- Microsoft
    
- Apple
    

---

## Red Team Assessment

A **red team** acts like a **real advanced attacker**.

### How it works:

- Black box
    
- Evasive
    
- Has a **specific goal**
    

Example goal:

- Steal sensitive data
    
- Access a critical server
    

Only reports:

- Vulnerabilities that helped achieve the goal
    

---

## Purple Team Assessment

### Red Team = Attackers

### Blue Team = Defenders

**Purple Team = Red + Blue working together**

### Why it’s useful:

- Red team finds weaknesses
    
- Blue team learns in real time
    
- Both improve defenses faster
    

Example:  
“We want better PCI-DSS compliance. Let’s attack our POS systems together.”

---

## Final Summary (Very Easy)

- **Vulnerability Assessment** → Find known issues
    
- **Penetration Testing** → Simulate real attacks
    
- **Security Audits** → Mandatory compliance checks
    
- **Bug Bounty** → Public hackers find bugs
    
- **Red Team** → Advanced attacker simulation
    
- **Purple Team** → Attack + defend together
