# Reporting in Security Assessments

Technical skills help you **find vulnerabilities**, but **reporting skills determine whether your work creates value**.

Even though vulnerability scanners automate detection, **humans must translate results into actionable, business-relevant information**. A strong security report bridges the gap between:

* Technical teams who need remediation details
* Executives who need risk visibility and priorities

A good report must be readable by **both technical and non-technical audiences**.

## Core Sections of a Vulnerability Assessment Report

A professional vulnerability assessment report typically contains the following sections:

1. Executive Summary
2. Overview of the Assessment
3. Scope and Duration
4. Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

Each section serves a **specific audience and purpose**.

---

## Executive Summary

The **Executive Summary** is written for:

* Executives
* Management
* Business decision-makers

### Purpose

* Provide a **high-level overview** of findings
* Highlight **critical risks**
* Enable **prioritization of remediation**

This section should **not** contain deep technical detail.

### What to Include

* Overall security posture
* Number of findings by severity
* Immediate risks that require urgent action
* Business impact (risk, compliance, exposure)

It is common to include a **visual summary**, such as:

* A chart showing the number of Critical, High, Medium, and Low vulnerabilities

Executives should be able to read **only this section** and still understand:

* How serious the situation is
* What needs to be fixed first

---

## Overview of the Assessment

The **Overview of the Assessment** explains **how the assessment was performed**.

### Purpose

* Establish transparency
* Build trust in the findings
* Provide methodological context

### What to Include

* Assessment methodology
* Testing approach
* Tools used (e.g., vulnerability scanners such as **Nessus**)
* Any limitations or assumptions

This section answers:

> “How did you test our environment?”

---

## Scope and Duration

The **Scope and Duration** section defines **what was authorized and tested**.

### Purpose

* Prevent misunderstandings
* Protect both client and assessor
* Clearly define responsibility

### What to Include

* In-scope IPs, domains, applications, or systems
* Out-of-scope exclusions (if applicable)
* Testing start and end dates
* Any constraints or restrictions

This section ensures findings are **legally and contractually valid**.

---

## Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

This is the **most technical and detailed section** of the report.

### Purpose

* Document validated vulnerabilities
* Provide actionable remediation guidance

### Best Practices

* Eliminate false positives before reporting
* Group findings by:

  * Severity
  * Vulnerability type
* Prioritize clarity over volume

---

## Required Elements for Each Vulnerability

Each finding should include the following components:

### 1. Vulnerability Name

A clear, descriptive title.

### 2. CVE

Reference to the associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID (if applicable).

### 3. CVSS

Severity score and rating to support risk prioritization.

### 4. Description of the Issue

* What the vulnerability is
* Why it exists
* Why it matters

Avoid assuming technical knowledge—explain clearly.

### 5. References

* Vendor advisories
* Official documentation
* Security research links

### 6. Remediation Steps

* Clear, actionable fixes
* Prefer vendor-recommended solutions
* Avoid vague guidance

### 7. Proof of Concept (PoC)

* Evidence that the issue exists
* Screenshots, command output, or logs
* Must be reproducible

### 8. Affected Systems

* Specific hosts, IPs, or applications impacted

## Closing Thoughts on Reporting

Reporting is **the most important part of any assessment**.

A strong report:

* Is concise and well-structured
* Uses clear language
* Explains technical concepts without jargon
* Allows any reader to understand risk and next steps

### Key Writing Principles

* Be precise
* Be factual
* Be audience-aware
* Use proper grammar
* Avoid unnecessary complexity

The best reports **drive remediation**, not confusion.

---

## Final Takeaway

Finding vulnerabilities is only half the job.
**Communicating them effectively is what makes you a professional.**

A well-written report:

* Builds trust
* Enables action
* Demonstrates expertise
