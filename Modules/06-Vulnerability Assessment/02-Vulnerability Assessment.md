## Vulnerability Assessment

A **Vulnerability Assessment (VA)** is a systematic process used to identify, analyze, and categorize security weaknesses in an organization’s systems, networks, and applications. It primarily relies on automated scanning tools and involves little to no manual exploitation.

The objective of a vulnerability assessment is to discover weaknesses and provide remediation guidance, not to actively exploit systems. In some engagements, clients may request limited validation of findings through minimally invasive techniques to confirm scanner results and eliminate false positives. Others may require only a comprehensive report of all identified vulnerabilities.

Before beginning a vulnerability assessment, it is critical to clearly define the scope and objectives. Vulnerability management plays a vital role in identifying weak points, understanding their risk level, and prioritizing remediation efforts. Organizations should always test patches in a controlled environment before deploying them to production to prevent operational disruptions.

## Vulnerability Assessment Methodology

A typical vulnerability assessment follows these eight steps:

1. Conduct risk identification and analysis
2. Develop scanning policies
3. Identify appropriate scan types
4. Configure the scanning tools
5. Perform the vulnerability scan
6. Evaluate identified risks
7. Interpret and validate results
8. Create a remediation plan

## Key Terms and Concepts

### Vulnerability

A **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in an organization’s applications, networks, or infrastructure that can be exploited by a threat actor. Vulnerabilities are commonly recorded in public databases and assigned a severity score using the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**.

CVSS scores range from 0 to 10 and are calculated based on factors such as:

* Attack vector
* Attack complexity
* Required privileges
* User interaction
* Impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Higher scores indicate higher severity and remediation priority.

---

### Threat

A **threat** is any circumstance or event with the potential to exploit a vulnerability. The likelihood of exploitation increases when a vulnerability is easy to exploit and offers a high reward to attackers.

---

### Exploit

An **exploit** is code, tools, or techniques used to take advantage of a vulnerability. Exploits are often publicly available through exploit databases or open-source repositories.

---

### Risk

**Risk** is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

In simple terms:

* Vulnerability: A weakness
* Threat: A possible attacker or harmful event
* Risk: The damage that may occur if exploitation happens

Risk is assessed using likelihood and impact. Vulnerabilities with high likelihood and high impact represent the highest risk and should be prioritized for remediation.

---

## Risk Evaluation Using Likelihood and Impact

Risk levels are determined by combining:

* Likelihood of exploitation
* Impact on the organization

Examples:

* Low likelihood and low impact result in low risk
* High likelihood and high impact result in critical risk

Organizations often use a qualitative risk matrix to prioritize vulnerabilities effectively.

## Asset Management

Asset management is the foundation of defensive security. An organization must first identify and understand its assets before it can protect them effectively.

---

## Asset Inventory

An asset inventory should include all organizational assets, such as:

### Data Storage Assets

* Endpoints (desktops, laptops, mobile devices)
* Servers
* External drives and removable media
* Legacy storage systems

### Cloud Assets

* Infrastructure hosted on cloud providers
* Multi-cloud environments
* Cloud storage and compute resources

### Software-as-a-Service Applications

* File storage platforms
* Collaboration tools
* Productivity suites

### Applications

* On-premises applications
* Cloud-based applications
* Software-as-a-Service platforms

### Network and Security Devices

* Routers and switches
* Firewalls
* Intrusion detection and prevention systems
* Data loss prevention systems

## Importance of Asset Inventory

* Organizations cannot secure assets they do not know exist
* Untracked assets are common attack targets
* Asset inventories must be updated whenever assets are added or removed

---

## Key Takeaways

* Vulnerability Assessment focuses on identifying weaknesses, not exploitation
* Risk is determined by likelihood and impact
* Asset inventory is the starting point of effective cybersecurity
* Proper remediation planning reduces long-term security risk
