## Getting Started with Nessus

This section explains how to **download, install, and configure Nessus for first-time use**. You can follow these steps on your own virtual machine to become familiar with Nessus features. In lab environments, Nessus and OpenVAS may already be pre-installed for practice.

---

## Downloading Nessus

To download Nessus:

1. Visit the official Nessus download page provided by **Tenable**
2. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system

For this walkthrough:

* Platform: Linux
* Package type: Debian-based (Ubuntu/Debian)
* Example package:
  `Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb`

Ensure the architecture matches your system (usually `amd64`).

---

## Requesting a Free Nessus License

Nessus requires an activation code, even for the free version.

1. Visit the Nessus activation page
2. Request an activation code for **Nessus Essentials**

Nessus Essentials:

* Free to use
* Limited to scanning **16 IP addresses**
* Intended for students, educators, and personal learning

Once requested, the activation code is sent via email.

---

## Installing the Nessus Package

After downloading the `.deb` file and receiving the activation code, install Nessus using `dpkg`.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb
```

During installation:

* Nessus core components are unpacked
* A systemd service (`nessusd`) is created
* Nessus is registered as a background service

---

## Starting the Nessus Service

Once installation is complete, start the Nessus daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
```

To verify that Nessus is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nessusd.service
```

---

## Accessing the Nessus Web Interface

Nessus is managed through a web interface.

1. Open a browser
2. Navigate to:

```
https://localhost:8834
```

If accessing remotely:

```
https://<server-ip>:8834
```

A browser security warning may appear because Nessus uses a self-signed certificate. This is expected in local or lab environments.

1. Select **Nessus Essentials**
2. Enter the activation code received earlier
3. Create a Nessus user account and strong password

After account creation:

* Nessus downloads and compiles plugins
* This process may take several minutes
* Scanning is unavailable until plugin initialization completes

---

## Using Preconfigured Lab Environments (If Provided)

In some lab setups, Nessus is already installed and configured.

Typical access details:

* URL: `https://<lab-ip>:8834`
* Username: `htb-student`
* Password: `HTB_@cademy_student!`

These credentials may also allow SSH access to the lab machine for configuration and troubleshooting.
