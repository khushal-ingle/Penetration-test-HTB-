## Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)

**Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)** is an international, publicly available information security standard used to describe and evaluate the security state of systems. It helps identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, installed software, and patch status **without exploiting systems**.

OVAL is co-supported by the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security** and is widely adopted across the security community. The OVAL repository contains **7,000+ publicly available definitions**.

OVAL is also a core component of the **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)**, maintained by **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, which standardizes automated vulnerability management, compliance checks, and security measurement.

## OVAL Assessment Process

OVAL follows a structured **three-step assessment model**:

1. **Identify system configurations** for testing
2. **Evaluate the current system state**
3. **Report the results**

System states identified by OVAL may include:

* Vulnerable
* Non-compliant
* Installed asset
* Patched

If a system is found non-compliant, remediation actions are applied and reassessed until compliance is achieved.

---

## OVAL Definitions

OVAL definitions are written in **XML format** and allow organizations to detect issues without active exploitation. This enables safer vulnerability identification and efficient patch management across large environments.

### Main Classes of OVAL Definitions

1. **OVAL Vulnerability Definitions**
   Identify known software vulnerabilities

2. **OVAL Compliance Definitions**
   Check whether system configurations meet security policies

3. **OVAL Inventory Definitions**
   Determine whether specific software or components are installed

4. **OVAL Patch Definitions**
   Verify whether required patches are applied

---

## OVAL Identifier Format

Each OVAL item has a unique identifier in the format:

```
oval:OrganizationDomain:IDType:IDValue
```

ID types include:

* `def` (definition)
* `obj` (object)
* `ste` (state)
* `var` (variable)

Example:

```
oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116
```

Many vulnerability scanners, such as **Nessus**, use OVAL to perform compliance and configuration-based security scans.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** is a publicly available catalog of known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures. It is sponsored by the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security**.

Each vulnerability is assigned a **unique CVE ID** by a **CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)**. This standardization ensures that vulnerabilities are referenced consistently across tools, vendors, and security teams.

A CVE entry typically includes:

* Vulnerability description
* Affected products
* References and advisories

CVE entries help organizations understand the severity and impact of vulnerabilities in their environments.

---

## CVE Assignment Criteria

For a vulnerability to receive a CVE ID, it must:

* Be independently fixable
* Affect a single codebase
* Be acknowledged and documented by the vendor

---

## Stages of Obtaining a CVE

### Stage 1: Identify Whether a CVE Is Required

The issue must meet CVE’s definition of a vulnerability:

* Exploitable code
* Negative impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability
* Requires a code or specification change to fix

Researchers must confirm that no existing CVE already exists.

---

### Stage 2: Contact the Affected Vendor

Researchers should make a good-faith effort to privately notify the vendor and follow responsible disclosure practices.

---

### Stage 3: Determine Appropriate CNA

* If the vendor is a CNA, they can assign the CVE
* If not, contact a third-party CNA

---

### Stage 4: Submit CVE Request Form

If vendor coordination fails, researchers can submit a request directly to the CVE Program using the official CVE web form.

---

### Stage 5: CVE Request Confirmation

A confirmation email is sent, and additional details may be requested by the CVE team.

---

### Stage 6: CVE ID Assignment

Once approved, a CVE ID is assigned but is **not yet public**.

---

### Stage 7: Coordinated Disclosure

Affected vendors and stakeholders are notified to prevent duplicate CVEs and ensure readiness.

---

### Stage 8: Public Announcement

The CVE ID is publicly announced once vendors are prepared.

---

### Stage 9: Publishing in the NVD

Details are published in the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** for public reference.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

Responsible disclosure ensures that vulnerabilities are reported privately to vendors first, allowing time for patch development before public disclosure.

Failure to follow responsible disclosure can result in **zero-day vulnerabilities**, where attackers exploit issues before fixes are available.

---

## CVE Examples

### CVE-2020-5902

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in **BIG-IP Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI)**. Exploitation allows full system takeover, including file modification and service control.

---

### CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare)

A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service. Although authentication is required, exploitation enables full system and domain compromise, including domain controllers.

---

## Key Takeaways

* OVAL enables non-intrusive vulnerability and compliance assessment
* CVE provides standardized vulnerability identification
* CVE IDs ensure consistent tracking across tools and vendors
* Responsible disclosure protects users from zero-day exploitation
